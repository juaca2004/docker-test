QUIZ

In my Dockerfile, I first use a Node.js container, in this case version 18, and set /app as the working directory. I first copy my dependency files (package.json and package-lock.json) there and run npm install to install the packages. Then I copy my entire project to the container and run npm run build, generating the build folder with the production-ready files. After switching to an Nginx container and copying the build folder from the Node stage to /usr/share/nginx/html, which is where Nginx serves the static files, I create a new folder called /usr/share/nginx/html. Finally, I expose port 80 and configure Nginx to run in the foreground when the container starts.

In the next part, I create the .yml for the workflow and configure a workflow that runs every time I push to the main branch. First, I run a job called build on an ubuntu-latest runner. Within the workflow, I complete several steps: first, I checkout my repository to access the files; then, I configure Docker Buildx to be able to build cross-platform images; then, I log in to Docker Hub using my secrets (DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD) to be able to upload the image; and finally, I build and upload the Docker image using the current context, tagging it with my Docker Hub username and the name docker-test:latest.
